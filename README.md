# TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization

Used the Functional API to built custom layers and non-sequential model types in TensorFlow, performed object detection, Image segmentation, and Interpretation of convolutions. Used generative Deep Learning(Unsupervised Learning) including Auto Encoding, VAEs, and GANs to create new content.

Organized by: [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), [Coursera](https://coursera.org/)
