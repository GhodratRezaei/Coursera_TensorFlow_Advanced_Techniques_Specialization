# TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization

Used the Functional API to built custom layers and non-sequential model types in TensorFlow, performed object detection, Image segmentation, and Interpretation of convolutions. Used generative Deep Learning(Unsupervised Learning) including Auto Encoding, VAEs, and GANs to create new content.

## Overview of Learning from the Specialization
This Specialization is devided in four main parts:
* [Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/custom-models-layers-loss-functions-with-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-advanced-techniques)
  * Build Network using Functional and Sequential API with main focus on Functional API including Siamese Network 
  * Build Custom Layers, Custom Loss Function (including Contrasive Loss Function in Siamese Network)
  * Building Network with Standard commom layers and using Lamda Layers for complex and arbitrary netwotrks 
  * Build custom classes instead of many Functional or Sequential APIs
  * Build models that can be inherited from the TensorFlow Model class, and build a residual network (ResNet) through defining a custom model class
  * Build Custom Callbacks using Class and also manually implement following callbacks : Tensorboard Callbacks, Early Stopping, Model Checkpoint, CSV Logger 
* [Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/custom-distributed-training-with-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-advanced-techniques)
  * Eager and Grapgh Mode in TensorFlow
  * Build Custom training Loops using Gradient Tape for more visibility and flexibility
  * Training using Distributed Training Methods and Training using multiple GPU or TPU cores 
* [Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-computer-vision-with-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-advanced-techniques)
  * Building Object Detection Networks (Classification and Localization(Regression)) including: R_CNN, Faster_RCNN, YOlO, SSD
  * Building Segmentation Networks (Semantic Segmentation and Instance Segmentation) incuding:
  Fully CNN, U-Net, DeepLab
  * Using Transfer Learning and Fine Tunning for Making Network incase of Data Scarcity and Time-consumption of training. 
  * Implemented image segmentation using variations of the fully convolutional network (FCN) including U-Net and Mask-RCNN to identify and detect numbers, pets, zombies
  * Building Saliency Maps and Class activation Maps(CAM and gradCAM) to identify which parts of the image are used by the classification model to take a decision.    
* [Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-deep-learning-with-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-advanced-techniques)
  * Build  a Generative Model(Neural Style Transfer and Fast Neural Style Transfer) to make a new image using Style and Content Image. 
  * Build simple and Stacked AutoEncoders on the familiar MNIST dataset, and more complex deep and convolutional architectures on the Fashion MNIST dataset to get the Latent representation of the image.
  * Denoising the Noisy image using CNN Auto Encoder 
  * Building VAriational AutoEncoder to Generate a new data not just reconstructed one.
  * Building GANs(Generative Adversial Networks) implementing the concept of two training phases(Discriminator and Generative)
